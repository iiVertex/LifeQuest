⚔️ AI LIFESTYLE COMPANION — UI + WIREFRAME BLUEPRINT
0. Product Identity

Core Concept:
An AI-driven lifestyle gamification app that converts real-world habits (health, finance, driving, etc.) into “XP, missions, and adaptive insights.”

Tone: Calm, premium, futuristic — not childish, not corporate.
UI DNA: Clean white space, modular cards, minimalist typography, AI-driven motion.

🧩 HANDOFF SUMMARY FOR DESIGNER

Primary Reference:

Orgo UI – clean SaaS modularity

Disney AI Assistant – personality integration

Design Goal:

UI must “breathe.” White space and motion carry emotional tone.

Never overload with text or icons.

AI presence should feel like an invisible guide — not a chatbot.
